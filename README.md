# HomeAssistantSupervisedInstall
These are the steps I used to install Home Assistant Supervised on a Raspberry Pi 4B.  I'm using it for monitoring power in my RV using 12VDC.  
I have a Victron SCC and Shunt.  I also connected a D1 Mini to read the serial output of the Victron devices.  This get sent via WiFi to an Influx DB via MQTT/NodeRed.
